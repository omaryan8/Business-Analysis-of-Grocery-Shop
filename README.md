# Business-Analysis-of-Grocery-Shop

This BDM Capstone project discusses the solutions to the challenges faced by a small
grocery shop located in Faridabad, Haryana. The significant problems of the business include
reduced footfall due to increased competition from online delivery applications and big
supermarkets, along with the corresponding high-cost prices by the distributors which limit
profit margins and other operational challenges such as increasing maintenance bills.
To elaborate on these challenges, the project studies the issues through various studies
projecting different aspects of the issue, with visual projections in the form of tables and pie
charts, among others. Additionally, a time series analysis is performed to illustrate the trend of
sales turnover over 12 weeks explaining the changes in demand and profitability. It should also
be noted that the overall analysis was hence made stronger with manual data cleaning,
organization, and visualization, to highlight the strong patterns detected in this
analysis
